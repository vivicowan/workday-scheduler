# Workday-Scheduler

## Description
- For this task, I wanted to test my abilities with JavaScript and make a quiz that has the design to store past scores and display them on a leader board. 
- I built this quiz to gain a better understanding of the JavaScript language as well as manipulating the DOM. Going through the process of building this quiz helped me grasp the logic that goes into JavaScript to create a decent quiz.
- This quiz helped me answer why JavaScript is such a popular client-side server. It truly is an amazing language that has so many possibilities.
- In this task, I learned many things that dealt with with not only JavaScript but as well as HTML and using Bootstrap for CSS. This quiz was the practice I needed to have a firm grip on the fundamentals of web-development.
